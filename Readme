Iâ€™m thrilled to share my journey into cybersecurity and present my Capture the Flag (CTF) capstone project. With a background in software development and cybersecurity, bolstered by my certifications in Certified in Cybersecurity and Security Plus, I'll guide you through my project where I successfully infiltrated a Windows 10 machine on the same network using various tools and techniques. Beginning with the ifconfig command to determine our IP address, I then employed nmap to scan the network, which revealed our target machine. Armed with the target's IP address, I performed a vulnerability scan using Nessus, uncovering the MS17-010 EternalBlue vulnerability of the traget machine. Utilizing Metasploit, I loaded the MS17-010 EternalBlue exploit module, set the RHOST to the target's IP, and the LPORT to 4444, and executed the exploit. Although the vulnerability was identified, SMB credentials were necessary, which I acquired using Hydra to brute force the user ID and password. With these credentials, I re-ran the exploit, successfully penetrating the Windows 10 machine, gaining access to its webcam, and ultimately capturing the flag. This project underscores my practical skills and commitment to cybersecurity, aiming to inspire and educate viewers on the critical importance of cybersecurity practices. Stay tuned to discover how you can protect yourself and enhance your cybersecurity knowledge. Connect with me for more insights as we work together to make the digital world a safer place.
